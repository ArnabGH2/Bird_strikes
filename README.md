# Bird_Strikes

This is the 1st project of my first internship by UM

## Problem Statement

In the realm of analytics, transport and communication stand as pivotal domains. Among the various modes of transportation, air transportation holds prominence for its popularity and convenience. However, it is imperative to acknowledge the prevalent challenge of bird strikes within this sector. Bird strikes represent a significant concern, warranting meticulous attention and strategic solutions to ensure the safety and efficiency of air travel operations.


Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater numbers of birds in flight at lower levels. To have a closer look the following document visually depicts the data collected on Bird Strikes by FAA between 2000-2011.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a xlsx file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that There was empty and null value.
- Step 5 : Remove empty value, null value and unnecessary column.
- Step 6 : In the report view, under the view tab, Enter a new theme
- Step 7 : Since the data contains various charts, thus in order to represent the data, a new visual was added using the three ellipses in the visualizations pane in report view. 
- Step 8 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for three fields named "Sky condition", "Year" & "Top 20 bird type".
- Step 9 : Two card visuals were added to the canvas, one representing Total bird strikes & other representing total Cost.
- Step 10 : Makde different charts base on our case study
- Step 11 : Different case studys are mentioned below

      (a) Visuals Depicting the Number of Bird Strike

      (b) Yearly Analysis & Bird Strikes in the US
  
      (c) Top 10 US Airlines in terms of having encountered bird strikes
  
      (d) Airports with most incidents of bird strikes â€“ Top 50
  
      (e) Yearly Cost Incurred due to Bird Strikesk

      (f) When do most bird strikes occur?

      (g) Altitude of Aero planes at the time of strike
  
      (h) Phase of flight at the time of the strike.
  
      (i) Average Altitude of the Aero planes in different phases at the time of strike
  
      (j) Effect of Bird Strikes & Impact on Flight
  
      (k) Effect of Strike at Different Altitude
  
      (l) Were Pilots Informed? & Prior Warning and Effect of Strike Relation

 #### A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop & it was then published to Power BI Service, and Make a PPT by findings main KPIs and discussing the  key insights.
